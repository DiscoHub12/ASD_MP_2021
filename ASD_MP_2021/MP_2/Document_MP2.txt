MINI-PROJECT N.2. 
Mainly, compared to mini-project number 1, this mini-project deals with the following classes:
1) AdjacencyMatrixUndirectedGraph <L> implements Graph <L>
to create an undirected graph using a variant of the representation 
of graphs with an adjacency matrix.
The following class must implement all the methods of Graph <L> 
(which unfortunately I cannot put due to copyright or privacy issues)
2) ForestDisjointSets using tree forests where each tree represents one 
of the disjoint sets
3) Implementation of an algorithm for calculating the connected components 
of an undirected graph using the ForestDisjointSets class.
4) Implementation of the Kruskal algorithm for the calculation 
of a minimum spanning tree in an undirected and weighted graph using the 
ForestDisjointSets class
5) Implementation of Prim's algorithm for the calculation of a minimum 
spanning tree in an undirected and weighted graph.
