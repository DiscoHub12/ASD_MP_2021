ALGORITHMS AND DATA-STRUCTURE MINI-PROJECTS. 
This repository contains two mini-projects developed to address 
the examination of Algorithms and Data Structures (of Computer Science in Camerino). 
For a matter of copyright and privacy, it is not possible to provide the interfaces 
made available and many other things such as documentation within the repository. 
In fact, the explanatory documents shown inside the mini-projects do not explain the 
whole project but a general view of the classes that have been implemented. 
Inside the code, the comments are written in Italian.
